#Nick C's Project 2 Read-me for Juicer Full-Stack App

##Installation and setup

Load project from the URL:

####https://shielded-earth-17510.herokuapp.com

##Description

The idea behind my app was to provide users with a way to find and advertise electric car charging points. By combining an API of publically available charging points and allowing users to create and book their own electric car drivers have an endless number of options so that they never have to get caught short of their final destination. 


##How to use Juicer

On loading the site users are given the option to log-in manually or using the Facebook oAuth API. Once logged in users can search for available public or user-created charge points. Users can book created charge points and leave, edit and delete comments for other users. 
Users can also create new charge points by entering their information and clicking on the map display to record the location. They can even upload an image so drivers know what to expect when they arrive. 

Users also have the ability to create edit and delete their user profiles

##Challenges Faced

This project was a huge undertaking with a lot of moving parts that all had to come together within the space of one week. I found it a huge challenge and had to make some compromises in the scope of the project in order to produce a presentable product. 
Understanding how all the different components of a restful app was difficult but by putting all the concepts and processes we learned over the previous weeks into practice really helped me to make progress and the experience of making my own custom restful app was invaluable.

##Improvements and Wishlist

- Refactoring
- Namespacing
- Improved styling with a fullsized map background with floating divs.
- Google places API suggesting local cafes for user to visit whilst their cars are charging.
